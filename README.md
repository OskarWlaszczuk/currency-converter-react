# Currency-converter project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description: 
Here is my personal currency-conventer project that will immediately help you find out how much Polish zlotys are worth in other currencies. It is simple to work with.

## How to use it?
1. First of all, you have to write numbers between 0.1 and 999999 in the form labeled *"Kwota w PLN"* (eng. *"Amount in PLN"*).
***

2. Then, you have to choose the currency that you are interested in, like:
- EUR
- USD
- CHF
- GBP
***


>You can do this by clicking the select element, under label named "Wybierz walutę* (ang. *"Choose currency"*) and clicking right currency name
***

3. In the last step you need to click button named *"Przelicz"* (eng. *"Convert"*). The converted amount will be displayed next to *"Wynik"* (eng.*"Result"*).
***

4. If you want to quickly reset form, click button named *"Wyczyść"* (ang. *"Reset"*).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
